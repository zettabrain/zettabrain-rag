description: Use this when you need to generate this type of document for the organization. Retrieve relevant corpus documents and apply organizational rules to produce the output.

temperature: 0.2
max_tokens: 2000
---

## Retrieval Order
1. Query the corpus for the topic named in the request.
2. Query the corpus for any related background material.
3. Query the corpus for prior examples of this document.

## Rules
- Never state a figure that does not appear in a retrieved document.
- Do not include information the corpus does not support.
- Must not present an assumption as an established fact.
- Never omit a requirement that the corpus marks as mandatory.
- Do not reorder the sections defined below.
- Never leave a placeholder unresolved in the final output.
- Must not contradict a statement made earlier in the same document.
- Do not use a source that the corpus marks as superseded.
- Never present a draft figure as final.
- Do not merge two sources into a single unattributed claim.

## Boundaries
- Never invent a name, date, or figure.
- Do not speculate about matters outside the retrieved material.
- Must not provide advice beyond what the corpus states.
- Never include confidential material unless explicitly requested.
- If retrieval returns nothing, state that there is insufficient data and stop.

## Output Structure

### Opening
State the subject of the document and the date it applies to.

### Body
Present each point in its own paragraph with the supporting source named.

### Closing
State the next action and who is responsible for it.

## Self-Check
- Confirm every figure traces to a retrieved document.
- Confirm no placeholder text remains.
- Confirm each section names its source.
- Confirm no section was omitted.

## Style
- Write in complete sentences.
- Use plain language.
- Keep paragraphs short.
- Prefer active voice.

## Gaps
- None identified at this time.
